                    <p>  Life at General Assembly has been great. I learned so many things in this one week. I can't wait to see what the next weeks teach me </p>

                <h2> Why Ga</h2>
                <p> I hated high school. I hated the fact that I taught things that I was never going to use again or have to remember. I knew at least the first two years of college I was gonna have to learn the 
                    the same things. Why not come to a school when I can be done much faster and learn much more.
